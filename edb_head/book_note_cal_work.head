You are required to show your work on each problem on this exam.  The following rules apply:\\
\\
<__|__>
\textbf{Organize your work}, in a reasonably neat and coherent way, in the space provided. Work scattered all over the page without a clear ordering will receive very little credit.
<__|__>
\textbf{Mysterious or unsupported answers will not receive full credit}. A correct answer, unsupported by calculations, explanation, or algebraic work will receive no credit; an incorrect answer supported by substantially correct calculations and explanations might still receive partial credit.
<__|__>
Please cross (or erase) \textbf{everything} you don't want. If both the correct solution and the wrong solution appear simutanously, we will just grade the wrong one.
<__|__>
If you need more space, use the back of the pages; clearly \textbf{indicate} when you have done this.
